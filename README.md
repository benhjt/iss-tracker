# iss-tracker
A web-app for tracking the position of the ISS written with [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) using several of the pre-made [components](elements.polymer-project.org) by the Polymer team. 

This project uses the great API from [Where the ISS at?](http://wheretheiss.at/w/developer).
