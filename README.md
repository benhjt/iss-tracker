# iss-tracker

A web-app for tracking the position of the ISS.

This project uses:

* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)
* Several of the pre-made [components](elements.polymer-project.org) by the Polymer team.
* The great API from [Where the ISS at?](http://wheretheiss.at/w/developer).
* Shashwat Kandadai's [Satellite.js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) for the SGP4/SDP4 calculations.
